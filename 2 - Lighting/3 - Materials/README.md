Change the light’s colors over time by changing the light’s ambient and diffuse colors via sin and glfwGetTime. Also change the light cube according to the object color!

Can you simulate some of the real-world objects by defining their respective materials like we've seen at the start of this chapter? Note that the table's ambient values are not the same as the diffuse values; they didn't take light intensities into account. To correctly set their values you'd have to set all the light intensities to vec3(1.0) to get the same output
